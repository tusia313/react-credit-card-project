# 🔮 Credit Card form 🔮

Simple project is React, where I can store the objects in state and working with it. Also it's nice remainder of working with form THUS handling the change in the inputs. Credit card's number (to be more specific - its start numbers) I can use to create a specific card visuals ! If that's not fascinating, I don't know what is :D

## 🃏 First look

On the front You can insert Your basic information - depending on Your number's start the background of the card (one among the three) is shown. What You put into proper input, at the same time appears on the card.

By when You start writing a CVV number, the front is switched to back. Amazing, is not? ;)
